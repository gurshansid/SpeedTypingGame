<h1>Speed Typing Game</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtube.com/shorts/fqrN266TQKc?feature=share) 

<h2>Description</h2>
This typing game consists of random words (in this case letters) that fall down the screen and must be typed out before hitting the bottom. The user has to type the word closest to the bottom to keep the game going. The current word being typed is highlighted red after keyboard input is registered. The words fall down faster the longer the game goes. Good luck!
